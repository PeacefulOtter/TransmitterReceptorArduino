# TransmitterReceptorArduino
An original project made in 3 days. The goal was to transmit a phrase with a laser and using the morse langage + Arduino Uno

# Infos & Programs
 - We used two arduino uno, but you can manage to fit it with only one. We just didn't have time to do a "perfect" thing.
 - images for the electronic assembly is available in ./img
 - One program for one arduino, each arduino must be plugged to one computer. You also can manage to use only one computer but again, no time :'(
